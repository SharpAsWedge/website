        Hi someone reading this website.<br>
        I'm still taking my first steps towards getting this website functional.<br>
        Maybe check in some other day and see how it's going?
    </p>
    <p>
        Till then, I think you should read the following text to keep you engaged:<br>
        It's just a story of why it has taken me this long to even start working on my own website.<br>
        I actually got this website like 2 years ago (this was written in 2024 so in 2022).
        And I had now idea how to host it on a serevr.<br>
        More importantly, I had no idea about how I would write the html or css.<br>
        Well I mean it's mostly because I'm lazy and not very creative.<br>
        But somehow today I got the urge to maybe get something going.<br>
        So on June 26, 2024, I'm writing this random gibberish which even I don't understand myself.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Alright then until next time!
    </p>
